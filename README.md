Sentry SDK for Unity
===========

> This is a work in progress.

For the stable Unity SDK, please go to [Sentry Unity Lite](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity-lite).

Install via `UPM`: `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity.git?path=/package`

## Sentry SDKs: Unity vs Unity Lite

Sentry's current stable SDK is on a [different repository called `sentry-unity-lite`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity-lite).

This repository is home of the new Sentry SDK for Unity with support to native crash support and offline caching.

If you'd like to get involved in the SDK development, you can [join Sentry's Discord server and say hi on the `#unity` channel](https://discord.gg/UmjjsgRAFa).

## Preview Demo
