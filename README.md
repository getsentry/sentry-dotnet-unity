Sentry SDK for Unity
===========

Install it via `UPM`: `https://github.com/getsentry/unity.git#x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is [the latest release](https://github.com/getsentry/unity/releases).

Check the Sentry [Unity documentation for more details](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unity/).

## Sentry SDKs: Unity vs Unity Lite

Sentry offers a minimalistic but stable SDK called `sentry-unity-lite`. It's available on a [different repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity-lite). That SDK is being replaced with the work done on this repository.

This repository is home of the new Sentry SDK for Unity with offline caching, performance monitoring and more.

> Note the goal is to soon add support to native crashes, release health and more features.

If you'd like to get involved in the SDK development, you can [join Sentry's Discord server and say hi on the `#unity` channel](https://discord.gg/UmjjsgRAFa).
